# spoterm
A ncurses CLI frontend for spotify, using playerctl and popen 

## Installation:
You can git clone the repository or simply download the script, then compile it with a C-Compiler of your choice

### Current Goals:
1) Move away from playerctl and directly use dbus/dbus.h
2) Show album covers
3) Fix issues with non-spotify mpris audio players(VLC, Firefox, Strawberry etc)
4) Windows compatability
